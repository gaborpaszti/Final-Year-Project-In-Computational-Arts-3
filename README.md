# Final-Year-Project-In-Computational-Arts-3
This repositori is created for the IS53047A: Final Year Project In Computational Arts (2020-21) module.

This project is about creating a space(tool) for human machine interaction as a means for creating art.

The computational part of this project aims to create interface for communication between the code and human;
and a creative environment in which this communication is happening.

The programming language used in this project is JavaScript so far. 
I used ML pose estimation (poseNet) and pixel manipulation at this point.
For this part of the project, I used these two tutorials to build this snippet of code:
Daniel Shiffman's 11.4: Brightness Mirror(https://youtu.be/rNqaw8LT2ZU?list=PL5HWV9mmp3eIKoJTTBGDN_4y9JtWNZGNv)
Daniel Shiffman's  ml5.js: Pose Classification with PoseNet and ml5.neuralNetwork(): (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYgYyq-xqAw)

I created my own model following the series of tutorials listed above. 

The sound and visual synthesis will be performed in separate app (e.g. Ableton, Max, Premier Pro).
